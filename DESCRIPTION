Description: Anscombe's quartet are a set of four two-variable datasets that 
    have several common summary statistics but which have very different joint 
    distributions.  This becomes apparent when the data are plotted, which 
    illustrates the importance of using graphical displays in Statistics.  This
    package enables the creation of datasets that have identical marginal sample
    means and sample variances, sample correlation and least squares regression 
    coefficients.  The user supplies an initial dataset, which is shifted, scaled 
    and rotated in order to achieve the target summary statistics.  Thus, the 
    general shape of the initial dataset is retained.
