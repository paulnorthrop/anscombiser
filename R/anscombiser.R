#' anscombiser: Create datasets with identical summary statistics
#'
#' Anscombe's quartet (Anscombe, 1973) are a set of four two-variable datasets
#' that have several common summary statistics but which have very different
#' joint distributions. This becomes apparent when the data are plotted, which
#' illustrates the importance of using graphical displays in Statistics.  This
#' package enables the creation of datasets that have identical marginal sample
#' means and sample variances, sample correlation, least squares regression
#' coefficients and coefficient of determination.  The user supplies an initial
#' dataset, which is shifted, scaled and rotated in order to achieve target
#' summary statistics.  The general shape of the initial dataset is retained.
#' The target statistics can be supplied directly or calculated based on a
#' user-supplied dataset.
#'
#' @details The main functions in `anscombiser` are
#'
#'   * [`anscombise`], which modifies a user-supplied dataset so that it shares
#'     sample summary statistics with Anscombe's quartet.
#'   * [`mimic`], which modified a user-supplied dataset so that is shares
#'     sample summary statistics with another user-supplied dataset.

#'   an overview of the package.
